 * If you want to add to work a function with more than one arguments then
 * a way to implement this is by passing a pointer to a structure.
 *
 * NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument to not get warnings.

 *
 *    void print_num(int num){

/**
 * @brief Wait for all queued jobs to finish
 *
 * Will wait for all jobs - both queued and currently running to finish.
 * Once the queue is empty and all work has completed, the calling thread
 * (probably the main program) will continue.
 *
 * Smart polling is used in wait. The polling is initially 0 - meaning that
 * there is virtually no polling at all. If after 1 seconds the threads
 * haven't finished, the polling interval starts growing exponentially
 * until it reaches max_secs seconds. Then it jumps down to a maximum polling
 * interval assuming that heavy processing is being used in the threadpool.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *    ..
 *    threadpool thpool = thpool_init(4);
 *    ..
 *    // Add a bunch of work
 *    ..
 *    thpool_wait(thpool);

 * The threads will be paused no matter if they are idle or working.

 * is called.
 *
 * While the thread is being paused, new work can be added.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *    threadpool thpool = thpool_init(4);
 *    thpool_pause(thpool);
 *    ..
 *    // Add a bunch of work
 *    ..
 *    thpool_resume(thpool); // Let the threads start their magic

 * @param threadpool    the threadpool where the threads should be paused
 * @return nothing

 * @brief Destroy the threadpool

 * int main() {
